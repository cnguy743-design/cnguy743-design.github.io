        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education, Society and Human Devopment ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a proactive, friendly, and energetic student who exceeds expectations at every interaction. I am timely and professional with strong communication skills. I am able to perform well under fast paced environments and pressure. I am a motivated leader who thrives in team environments and can solve complex problems with effective communication and collaboration. I have worked and volunteered with different duties and responsibilities. I have learned to adapt to my surroundings and learn to multi-task. I have established skills in customer service, food preparation, event planning, and sales. I developed skills in customer service and customer satisfaction at a fast food chain. Iâ€™ve learned to engage with customers in diverse settings, learning styles, and purposes. Iâ€™ve become more empathetic, hardworking, caring, and organized. With more responsibilities, I manage to balance my work ethic and social/academic very well. My experiences have prepared me to teach, encourage, and motivate other learners and individuals in any setting. <br><br>

      I have dedicated my time and energy volunteering at a local preschool and various organizations. My time there shaped who I am today - a patient, nurturing, and responsible woman. I gained hands-on experience and acted as a mentor to young developing children. My role involved problem-solving, active listening, time management, and interpersonal skills. I am well-qualified to work under stressful environments. Being able to expand my experience at a young age has allowed me to gain proper familiarity with different behaviors, natures, and the importance of boundaries. Volunteering at a preschool comes with other responsibilities as well, such as speaking with parents/staff, cleaning, and creating activities. I perform duties like laundry, vacuuming, wiping tables, organizing, and scrubbing bathrooms. I learned to express myself properly and professionally, ensuring that parents and staff understand what is going on with their children. I would also have to keep children engaged with activities like puzzles, hide-seek, coloring, tag, or imaginative play. I read books and prepared materials ahead of time. <br><br>

      Pursuing a career in education has always been my passion. Working with children and becoming a high school teacher is my main objective. I want to make a difference in the lives of others. Expanding my education allows me to grow as a person, building discipline habits, improvement, and positive relationships. Taking an educational approach and opportunities is my top priority. I highly believe that in order to succeed, I must take advantage of resources, workshops, and mentorship to achieve my goals. I must take every opportunity that comes across my way to invest in my future career. Iâ€™ve gained skills in designing fun activities that will encourage students to engage and participate, helping them develop skills in language, team-work, and curiosity. Building a safe environment is a priority. Ensuring that children are comfortable in their work, not afraid to ask for help or guidance, is what I look forward to. My volunteering experience has provided me with a strong foundation in teaching. Volunteering for over 5+ years has ensured my dedication and passion for working with children.
